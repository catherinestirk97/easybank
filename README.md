# Frontend Mentor - Easybank landing page solution

This is a solution to the [Easybank landing page challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/easybank-landing-page-WaUhkoDN). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects. 

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- Hover over certain elements for interactivity 
- See that the build matches the designs 

### What I learned

- This was the first project where I coded a responsive navigation bar from scratch. I wanted to do this without using any example code for reference, as I wanted to work it out using the logic I believed it would use. There was a lot of tinkering involved, and an accidental bug which I had to find out how to fix (this bug involved the mobile active styles remaining on desktop if the user didn't close the menu again while on mobile - this allowed me to learn about the "resize" event handler, which would be used to fix this bug.). 
- The importance of carefully considering both mobile and desktop designs when writing the HTML, to allow a smooth transition when writing media queries for responsive design.
- Positioning elements with z-index/having overlapping elements
